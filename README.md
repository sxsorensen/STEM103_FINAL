My name is Stacy Sorensen and I'm a student learning Python at Everett Community College.

# ABOUT THE PROGRAM
Program created to calculate a payment or principal amount for a loan. Uses simple interest in the calculation and outputs the payment schedule to a CSV file. One new thing I learned in doing this project was using functions from the datetime library including date, today, and strptime. Also utilized Pandas to more easily convert the data to columns for export.
